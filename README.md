## Main requirements

### 

Python >= 3.8
torch1.12.1+cu113 and torch2.0.1+cu118

# Combined Commands Example


### Prepare the input data
We currently support the output directory generated by most gaussian splatting methods such as [3DGS](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting), [mip-splatting](https://github.com/autonomousvision/mip-splatting), [GaussianPro](https://github.com/kcheng1021/GaussianPro) with the following minimal structure:
```
- output_dir
    - cameras.json (necessary)
    - point_cloud 
        - iteration_xxxx
            - point_cloud.ply (necessary)
```

We are preparing some [demo data(comming soon)]() for quick-start testing. 


### Running the Mesh Extraction

To extract a mesh from the input data, run the following command:
```
gs-extract-mesh -m ./data/1750250955326095360_data/result -o ./output/1750250955326095360_data
```
Replace `./data/1750250955326095360_data/result` with the path to your input output_dir.
Replace `./output/1750250955326095360_data` with the desired path for the output mesh.
